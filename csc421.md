Lecture 2

Problem
1) Initial state (eg "Arad")
2) Actions & successor function 
	sf(state, action) -> next state
	ex// sf("Arad", gotoTimis) -> Timis 
3) Goal test 
	isGoal(state) -> True/False
	isGoal("Arad") -> False
	isGoal("Bucharest") -> True

4) Step Cost function
	step (state1, state2) -> number

5) Solution: path of states from initial to final

<h6>Implementation: states vs. nodes</h6>
A state is a representation of a physical configuration
A node is a bookkeeping data structure constituting of
	
	- state
	- parent node
	- action
	- path cost (g)
	- depth

Frontier: collection of nodes that've been generated but not expanded

TreeSearch( problem ) return solution or failure
	init frontier with a node for the init state
	loop do
		if frontier is empty -> return failure
		n = frontier.remove()
		if problem.isGoal( n.state ) return n
		expand n, add successor nodes to frontier
		
<h6>Search strategies</h6>

Dimensions
1) Completeness - Does it find A solution
2) Time completeness
3) Space complexity
4) Optimality (Does it return the best solution?)

b: max branching
d: depth of best solution
m: max deth

<h6>BFS</h6>
Complete ? yes even w/o "explored"
Time ? b + b^2 + b^3 + ... + b^d = 0(b^(d+1)) -> where d is the depth of shallowest solution
Space ? O(b^(d+1)) Because we need to remember all nodes in frontier & their ancestors
Optimality? optimal if time is constant

Overhead of starting from scratch each time in IDS, 11%

classes of searches
uniformed
 - dont use any background knowledge of the domain
informed 
- uses background knowledge

<h6>Lecture 3</h6>

node <-> states
edges <-> actions

<h6>defining a problem formally</h6>

1. inital state
2. actions and succesor functions
3. goal test
4. step cost

a solution leads from init state to goal state

<h6>frontier</h6>
set of nodes that have been generated but not expanded

<h6>best-first search</h6>
Greedy: f(n)=h(n)
greedy
complete? no
time? O(b^m)
space? O(b^m)
optimal? no

<h6>A* search</h6>
Evaluation function: f(n) = g(n)+h(n)
this small change makes the algorithm complete

<h6>Admissible</h6>
never overestimate
