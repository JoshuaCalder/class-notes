<h5>1. Computer Organization</h5>

Focusing on cache lvl 2, cpu, main memory and disk in this class
<h5>2. CPU</h5>

- ALU
- PC
- Lvl 1 Cache
- Registers
- Clock

What happens when i++?

<h5>3. Memory</h5>
- (smallest) Registers (fastest)
- Level-1 cache
- Level-2 cache
- Main Memory
- Disk
- (biggest) USB CD (slowest)

<h5>4. I/O</h5>
<h6>Access</h6>
Address: C port numbers, pin numbers ...
Need to know whether using interrupt, DMA (Direct Memory Access)

<h6>Synhronous vs asynchronous I/O</h6>

<h6>Interrupt vs. Trap</h6>
Trap:  is a software-generated interrupt that is programmer initiated and expected to transfer control to an outlined handler routine

Interrupt: A program control interruption based on an external hardware event external to the CPIT (ex: pressing a key on the keyboard)

<h6>DMA (Direct Memory Access)</h6>
Why do we need this?
CPU is pretty busy. For transfer of large sizes of data, it is wasteful to use CP to do the job -> special type of processor

The job for the CPU: tell DMA the source address of the data, & the destination address of the data, & the size of the data

<h6>5. Computer Architectures</h6>
- single processor system
- multi processor system
- cluster systems (multiple systems connected together)
- distributed systems

Lecture 2
<h2>Part 2: Overview of the OS</h2>
<h6>1. History</h6>
Requirement change<br>
Before: Computers were expensive<br>
Goal: Efficiently use computers<br>
Result: Share Computers<br>
Now: Users become more "expensive"<br>
Goal: Efficiently use computers<br>
Result: Share users

<h6>Maximum # of processes that a user can run</h6>
% ulimit -u <br>

set limit to lower than what you have access to
ex// if 50, use 45 

uniprogramming: 1 program running at 1 time ex// DOS
multiprogramming: many programs at a time

<h6>2. Batch processing vs. time sharing</h6>
batch processing:

-	load a pool of jobs
-	execute one job until it terminates of <i>or</i> it is blocked
-	pick next job to run

time sharing:

-	execute one job up to a certain time (time slice)
-	switch to another one to execute
-	most popular is round-robin 
-	uses cpu scheduling

Batch processing doesn't have any fixed time limit
Time sharing repsonse time is faster, but uses more CPU

<h6>3. Main tasks of OS</h6>
3.1 Process management<br>
3.2 Memory Management<br>
3.3 Storage and I/O management<br>
3.4 User management

<h6>3.1 Process Management</h6>

-	create, delete, suspend, resume processes
-	schedule processes
-	synchronization
- IPC (Inter. process communication)

<h6>3.2 Memory Management</h6>

-	Store data (Access data in main memory)
- 	Keep track of available space in main memory
-  Allocate and reclaim memory
-  Swap in/out virtual memory

<h6>3.3 Storage and I/O management</h6>

-	File systems
-	Printer & Network Devices (uses the device driver)

<h6>3.4 User management</h6>
-	Authentication
-	Authorization
-	Accounting
% es -l  -> tells you what is access control
