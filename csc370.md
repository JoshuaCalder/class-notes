Relational Databases 

Database-Schema -> Relations (Tables) -> Tuples -> Attribute (Atomic)

<h6>First Normal Form</h6>

a : type1 (int)      b: type2 (int)
YES, this is in normal form

a : type1 (array of ints)
NO, this is not in normal form

- Postgres allows you to break first normal form

<h6>Relationship Database Management System</h6>
- Oracle
- Postgres
- MySQL
- SQLite
- SQLServer

<h6>Types</h6>
Some types 

- INT
- REAL
- CHAR CHAR(10)
- TEXT 

Type determines the domain, meaning all potential values something can be

Instance:
Actual values that we store

Primary keys of a relation are represented with an underscore

Every relation needs a primary key. Primary keys consist of one or more attributes

<hr>

<h6>Functional Dependencies</h6>

Given A1A2 ... An we can determine B1 ... Bn

ex// 

- sid,sname -> address
- sid -> sname
- sid -> sid TRUE
- sid -> R

<h6>Superkey</h6>
A set of attributes {A1, ... An} is a superkey of R iff A1, ... An -> R

<h6>Candidate Key</h6>
A candidate key is a combination of attributes that can be uniquely used to identify a db record without referring to any other data. Every relation can have one or more candidate. One of them will be selected as a primary key.
<br>
Good example of candidate key: International Standard Book Numbers<br>
Bad example of candidate key: Phone numbers (sometimes reused)

A candidate key is a superkey that is minimal

We cannot define a FD based on 1 instance

Example relation based on slides
FD: title, year -> len, genre, studio
SK: title, year, len, genre, studio, starName
CK: title, year, starName

- every relation should have a superkey & primary key
- primary key is a candidate key

<h6>Armstrong's Axioms</h6>
Reflexivity: y âŠ† x then x-> y<br>
Augmentation: If x -> y then XZ->YZ for any X<br>
Transitivity: If X->Y then XZ -> YZ for any Z<br> 
From these 3, we can derive the following 2<br>
Union IF x->y and x->z then x-> yz<br>
Decomposition If x->yz then x->y, x->z
