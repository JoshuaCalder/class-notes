<h3>Lecture 1</h3>
<h6>3 parts to a data model</h6>

1. Structre
2. Operations
3. Constraints

<h6>Relational Model</h6>
Basic concepts<br>

- Attributes are like table columns, attribute names have meaning for us
- Tuple is a row in a relation
- Domain is like a type and in most normal forms is atomic
- Relation schema: relation name plus an attribute list
- optionaly has domains / types of attributes
- Relation instance: a set of tuples for a given relation schema (can change over time)
- Database is a collection of relations
- Database schema is the set of relation schemas

Ch. 3

Relational Databases 

Database-Schema -> Relations (Tables) -> Tuples -> Attribute (Atomic)

<h6>First Normal Form</h6>

a : type1 (int)      b: type2 (int)
YES, this is in normal form

a : type1 (array of ints)
NO, this is not in normal form

- Postgres allows you to break first normal form

<h6>Relationship Database Management System</h6>
- Oracle
- Postgres
- MySQL
- SQLite
- SQLServer

<h6>Types</h6>
Some types 

- INT
- REAL
- CHAR CHAR(10)
- TEXT 

Type determines the domain, meaning all potential values something can be

Instance:
Actual values that we store

Primary keys of a relation are represented with an underscore

Every relation needs a primary key. Primary keys consist of one or more attributes

<hr>

<h6>Functional Dependencies</h6>

Given A1A2 ... An we can determine B1 ... Bn

A functional dependency A->B in a relation holds if two tuples having same value of attribute A have the same value of attribute B

ex// 

- sid,sname -> address
- sid -> sname
- sid -> sid TRUE
- sid -> R

<h6>Superkey</h6>
A set of attributes {A1, ... An} is a superkey of1 R iff A1, ... An -> R

<h6>Candidate Key</h6>
A candidate key is a combination of attributes that can be uniquely used to identify a db record without referring to any other data. Every relation can have one or more candidate. One of them will be selected as a primary key.
<br>
Good example of candidate key: International Standard Book Numbers<br>
Bad example of candidate key: Phone numbers (sometimes reused)

A candidate key is a superkey that is minimal

We cannot define a FD based on 1 instance

Example relation based on slides
FD: title, year -> len, genre, studio
SK: title, year, len, genre, studio, starName
CK: title, year, starName

- every relation should have a superkey & primary key
- primary key is a candidate key

<hr>
<h6>Armstrong's Axioms</h6>
Reflexivity: y âŠ† x then x-> y<br>
Augmentation: If x -> y then XZ->YZ for any X<br>
Transitivity: If X->Y then XZ -> YZ for any Z<br> 
From these 3, we can derive the following 2<br>
Union IF x->y and x->z then x-> yz<br>
Decomposition If x->yz then x->y, x->z

<br>
<h4>textbook notes</h4>
<h6>Functional Dependency</h6>

title year -> length genre studioName

this is a functional dependency because if 2 values share the same title and year value, then they must share the same length genre and studioName value

title -> starName is not a functionaly dependency

key if it determines all other attributes

It's called functional because it takes a list of attributes and produces a unique output

<h6>Superkeys</h6>
- superkeys do not have to be minimal
- they are however keys

<h6>The splitting / combining rule</h6>
Splitting rule<br>
A1A2 -> B1B2 can be split into A1A2 -> B1 and A1A2 -> B2

Combining rule<br>
A1A2 -> Bi for i=1,2,etc. can be combined into A1A2->B1B2,etc.

ex//<br>
title year -> length<br>
title year -> genre<br>
title year -> studioName<br>
<br>
This can be combined into <br>
title year -> length genre studioName
<br>
Caution: No splitting rule for the left sides!

<h6>Trivial Functional Dependencies</h6>
A trivial FD is when the right side is a subset of the left hand side
ex//<br>
title year -> title

<h6>Computing the closure of attributes</h6>
We denote the closure of a set of attributes with {A1,A2...}^+
<br>
ex//<br>
R(A,B,C,D)<br>
A -> B<br>
B -> D<br>
C -> B<br>

Closure is the set of attributes that can be determined with that attribute.<br>
ex A^+ closure is the set of attributes that can be determined with A
<br>
Note that from A you can always determine A
<br>
So A^+ is ABD
<br>
because A determines B and B determines D. However, we cannot determine C
